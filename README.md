# CEP146 – Lab 09: Prompt Engineering with AI
### Final Submission – Anita (yli780)

## 1. Purpose

The goal of this lab is to learn how to design effective prompts for AI tools. I practiced comparing poor and good prompts, adding useful details like audience, constraints, and formatting. I also learned how to use advanced prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative refinement to solve a problem more effectively.

## 2. Exercise 1 – Your First Prompts

---

### 2.1 Scenario 1 – Email Declining an Invitation

#### Poor Prompt
> “Write an email to say I can’t go.”

**Why it is poor:**  
The prompt gives no details about the situation. There is no audience, tone, or context, so the AI cannot produce a professional or appropriate email.

#### Good Prompt
> “Write a polite and professional email declining a coworker’s invitation to a team dinner.  
> Use a friendly tone, express appreciation, give a brief reason (schedule conflict), and suggest reconnecting later.  
> Format the email in three short paragraphs.”

**Why it is good:**  
This prompt clearly states the audience, tone, purpose, and format, so the AI can generate a more suitable email.

---

### 2.2 Scenario 2 – Explain Photosynthesis

#### Poor Prompt
> “Explain photosynthesis.”

**Why it is poor:**  
The prompt does not say who the explanation is for, so the AI may use scientific vocabulary that some people cannot understand.

#### Good Prompt
> “Explain photosynthesis to a Grade 5 student using simple everyday language.  
> Constraints: maximum 120 words, include one real-life example, avoid scientific jargon.”

**Why it is good:**  
The prompt identifies the audience, difficulty level, word limit, and example requirements. The AI will produce a clearer and simpler explanation.

---

### 2.3 Scenario 3 – Recipe Suggestions

#### Poor Prompt
> “Give me dinner ideas.”

**Why it is poor:**  
There are no dietary restrictions, cooking skill level, time limits, or format directions. The AI cannot guess what the user needs.

#### Good Prompt
> “Suggest three easy dinner recipes for a beginner cook.  
> Constraints: vegetarian only, no nuts, must take under 25 minutes.  
> Present the output in a table with columns: Recipe Name | Ingredients | Steps (3–4 steps).”

**Why it is good:**  
The prompt includes diet requirements, cooking skills, time constraints, and a structured output format.

### 2.4 Pair Discussion Reflection

During the pair discussion, I identified missing details in my partner’s prompts, such as tone, audience, and format. I suggested adding more context to make prompts clearer and more useful. I also received helpful feedback that encouraged me to be more specific. The discussion helped me better understand how to make a high-quality prompt.

## 3. Exercise 2 – Problem-Solving with AI (Event Planning)

### 3.1 Scenario Selected
Our group chose the **Event Planning** scenario and planned a birthday party using progressive prompts.

---

### 3.2 Prompt Sequence

#### Prompt 1 – Baseline (Vague)
> “Help me plan an event.”

This prompt is too vague and shows why context is necessary.

---

#### Prompt 2 – Basic Context
> “I’m planning a birthday party for about 12 people with a $300 budget. Please give me a simple outline.”

Adds event type, guest count, and budget.

---

#### Prompt 3 – Constraints + Personalization
> “The birthday party is for a 10-year-old who loves outdoor games. It will be held at a local park. Please suggest safe and budget-friendly activities and a preparation checklist.”

Adds age, interests, location, and safety constraints.

---

#### Prompt 4 – Format Requirements
> “Please present the output in two sections: (1) Timeline schedule, (2) Preparation checklist in bullet points.”

Adds clear structure.

---

#### Prompt 5 – Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
> “Before giving the final plan, list your step-by-step reasoning about safety, feasibility, and budget distribution.”

Adds reasoning and improves decision-making.

---

#### Prompt 6 – Iterative Refinement
> “Revise the plan by adding a weather backup plan, a parent-supervision schedule, and a simplified shopping list. Keep everything within the $300 budget.”

Adds practical details and improves the final plan.

---

### 3.3 Group Presentation Summary

In our group presentation, we explained how each prompt added more clarity, structure, and constraints. We also compared strategies with other groups. We explained why chain-of-thought and iterative refinement help produce a safer, more realistic plan.

## 4. Reflection and Rubric Alignment

### Reflection
Through this lab, I learned that good prompts must include audience details, constraints, tone, and structure. I also saw how reasoning and refinement create better AI responses. This lab helped me understand how to guide AI step-by-step instead of giving vague instructions.

### Rubric Alignment Table

| Rubric Requirement | Evidence in My Work |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Poor + Good prompts for 3 scenarios | Completed for email, photosynthesis, recipes |
| Understanding of differences | Explained why poor prompts fail and why good prompts work |
| Included audience, format, constraints | Present in all good prompts |
| Pair discussion participation | Included reflection section |
| Group scenario chosen | Event Planning selected |
| Comprehensive strategy | Six prompts showing progression |
| Advanced techniques | Chain-of-thought + constraints + refinement |
| Group presentation | Summary included |
| Engagement | Clear evidence of understanding and application |
